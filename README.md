## [LIVE DEMO](https://chocobuckle.github.io/question2/)

To make things more interesting for myself - and hopefully you! - the initial 4 cells are dynamically created and injected into 'div.grid' once the 'window.onload' event fires. When the user toggles the "show inner flexible grid?" switch we grab each of the cells created on page load and dynamically create and inject a further 4 cells into each of them, thereby creating the inner flexible grid.
